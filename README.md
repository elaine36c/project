Suggestions for what to do welcome.

What langauges do you code in?  I've been slowly teaching myself Python and wanted to try and develop a webscraper, or something similar to grab the updated delivery time on my woolies online orders.  Do you use woolies?

Unlike ocado in the UK, they give you a window that updates, but you have to click on a link to get the updates, i wanted my google calendar to get the updated time or maybe even send myself and email or text if the time updates.  

Interested?  

I actually learnt to code in Java originally! I've heard a lot about how it's one of the more complicated languages, but was still interesting nonetheless. At least it helped me understand the basics of coding!
